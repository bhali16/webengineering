          Gradient made easy

          This can come in handy, specially once you`ve already styled
          everything and you are just lookig to add in a nice, subtle gradient a
          litel bit later on in the process. It can be used at any time through,
          and it makes adding in subtle (and not so subtle) gradient really
          easy!
